		AI can deal with many complex issues and help programmers to complete more tasks in less time
		and become more productive. It helps us to code more accurately by reducing common mistakes and
		cutting down repetitive coding by suggesting the next code that you might type. Besides reducing
		the number of errors, it also ensures that programmers will spend less time searching for
		reference codes. It is a tool that will end up boosting human productivity and help programmers
		do their everyday work a lot faster by finding the basic building blocks they need or pointing
		them toward new ideas. It is useful not only for an experienced programmer but could also help
		novices learn to code.
